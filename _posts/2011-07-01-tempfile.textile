Nowadays, my favorite way of working with tempfiles as temporary storage is by using the @IO::All@ module:

<pre class="brush: perl">
use strict;
use IO::All;
my $temp = io '?';
"some temp data" >> $temp ;
$temp->seek(0,0);  # reset back to the top of the file
print $temp->slurp;
</pre>

Or you can use that good-old Perl built-in module, @File::Temp@ (from perlfaq5):

<pre class="brush: perl">
use File::Temp qw/ tempfile tempdir /;

my $dir = tempdir( CLEANUP => 1 );
($fh, $filename) = tempfile( DIR => $dir );

# or if you don't need to know the filename

my $fh = tempfile( DIR => $dir );
</pre>
