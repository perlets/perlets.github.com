Here's a quick-and-dirty static webserver based on Plack, useful while developing.

Install plack:

@cpan Plack@

Then just create a file called @serve@ somewhere in your path.

<pre class="brush: bash">
plackup -MPlack::App::Directory -MCwd \
   -e 'Plack::App::Directory->new(root => getcwd);' $@
</pre>

Then, from the root web project, do this:

<pre class="brush: bash">
cd mywebproject
serve
</pre>

If you're using Windows, create a file named @serve.bat@, with the following content (replacing $\@ for %%, and double-quotes):

<pre class="brush: bash">
plackup -MPlack::App::Directory -MCwd \
    -e "Plack::App::Directory->new(root => getcwd);" %%
</pre>
