Sometimes you just feel tired of using a lot of modules on top of your Perl program everytime, even for the tiniest scripts.

There's a module, @rig@, that will do just that.

<pre class="brush: perl; class-name: codeclass">
use rig modern, io; 

my $yy = { foo=>'bar', baz=>10 };
pp $yy;  # pretty print

my $contents = io < 'file.txt';

</pre>

You can write your own rig via the @~/.perlrig@ YAML file. 

Try writing your own with your favorite modules:

<pre class="brush: js">
fav:
    use:
       - strict
       - File::Slurp:
          - slurp 
       - feature:
          - say
classy:
    use:
       - MooseX::Declare
</pre>

Then use it anywhere for a quick and stylish Perl from anywhere:

<pre class="brush: bash">
perl -Mrig=fav -e 'say slurp "file.txt"'
</pre>
